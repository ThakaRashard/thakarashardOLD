Im not stable in LongBeach right now so im working out of every library on the Subway and LightRail Metrolosangeles lines, Im working on my personal web infrastructure. I lost me Momentum on my M_R_O and Cassini work i was compiling. I keep my favorites in Google Chrome but if i cannot get to a place that will let me use my ChromeProfile im super disabled. Please bear with me! I have Typography work thats not life or death but it got me a logical chance to send a tweet to vogue. I know magazines get taken over so im not a threat to talk to them. But there was friction between me and the girls bodygaurds. They were stalking me. I can swear I saw muna in an issue when i Arrived. I cant talk to Cardi_B! She know everything!

She had the same symptoms I wake up with at After dealing with Childrens Hospital and Cancer only to find my late wife is with an athlete that has a bigger dick than me...



### Basic concepts of flexbox
The flexible box layout module (usually referred to as flexbox) is a one-dimensional layout model for distributing space between items and includes numerous alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will explore in more detail in the rest of these guides.

In a disheartening turn of events, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has announced that it’s laying off about 8% of its workforce. That means that about 530 JPL employees will be let go, along with about 40 employees of the Lab’s contractors. That sucks for the people being let go, but the bigger concern for the rest of us is what will happen to upcoming missions like Mars Sample Return (MSR)?[ReadMoreOnUniverseToday!](https://www.universetoday.com/165651/nasas-jpl-lays-off-hundreds-of-workers/)

### [The Global CTX Mosaic of Mars](https://murray-lab.caltech.edu/CTX/index.html)

The Bruce Murray Laboratory for Planetary Visualization has completed a 5.7 terapixel mosaic of the surface of Mars rendered at 5.0 m/px. Each pixel in the mosaic is about the size of a typical parking space, providing unprecedented resolution of the martian surface at the global scale.

We emphasize transparency both in how the mosaic was generated and for users to understand where data in the mosaic come from. We have developed a Python-based pipeline that incorporates non-destructive image processing techniques that preserve all information about the original data that comprise the mosaic and map all seams..

>NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance mission captured thrilling footage of its rover landing in Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The real footage in this video was captured by several cameras that are part of the rover's entry, descent, and landing suite. The views include a camera looking down from the spacecraft's descent stage (a kind of rocket-powered jet pack that helps fly the rover to its landing site), a camera on the rover looking up at the descent stage, a camera on the top of the aeroshell (a capsule protecting the rover) looking up at that parachute, and a camera on the bottom of the rover looking down at the Martian surface.

The SNC-meteorites are a group of Achondrite meteorites, by them is assumed, that they originate from the Mars.
Shergottite meteorites are often made of mineral grains that can't be seen clearly without a microscope. The brown areas are grains of the mineral pyroxene and the clear white areas are the mineral plagioclase. These are the two most abundant minerals in a mafic magma of the Earth...[ReadMore](https://www.b14643.de/SNC-Meteorites/) [LEW88516 – 13.2 grams Lherzolitic Shergottite](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/mmc/lew88516.pdf)

### MARS METEORITE ALH 84001
Date: 05 April 2001
Copyright: NASA/JSC

This Martian meteorite is thought by some scientists to contain evidence of life on Mars. The rock is designated ALH84001, after the Allan Hills in Antarctica where it was found. [EuropeanSpaceAgency](https://sci.esa.int/web/mars-express/-/26756-mars-meteorite-alh-84001)

### Terrestrial Age
The “terrestrial age” of a meteorite is how long ago the meteorite fell to Earth. If people witnessed the meteorite’s fall, then its terrestrial age is obvious. But most meteorites, and all Antarctic meteorites like ALH 84001, fell without being noticed by people. Fortunately, terrestrial ages of meteorites can also be calculated from the abundances of some naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of chemical elements. These radioactive isotopes are formed in a meteorite, in space, as it is bombarded by cosmic rays (high-energy elementary particles). After a meteorite lands on Earth, it isn’t hit by cosmic rays any more, no more of the radioactive isotopes form, and the ones already in the rock continue decaying away. So, the more of these isotopes in a meteorite, the less time it has spent on Earth. Terrestrial ages are usually determined from isotopes of the elements carbon (14C), beryllium (10Be), and chlorine (36Cl).

The best measure of ALH 84001’s terrestrial age comes from its abundance of carbon-14 (14C). Carbon-14 dating is most commonly used to get ages for things like archaeological artifacts and the Shroud of Turin. The abundance of carbon-14 in ALH 84001 gives a terrestrial age of about 13,000 years [(Jull et al., 1995)](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/meteorites/ALH84001_References.html#JUL95).

The National Science Foundation (U.S.) sponsors meteorite-collecting expeditions to Antarctica nearly every year. Meteorites are not abundant anywhere on Earth, but are easier to find in Antarctica than elsewhere on Earth. It’s easy to see black meteorites on the white ice. Also, meteorites that fall onto the Antarctic ice are frozen and preserved much better than they would be anywhere else on Earth. Photo c/o Ursula Marvin, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. ALH 84001 was found in Antarctica during the 1984-1985 Antarctic summer. It was found by a team of meteorite hunters from the ANSMET program, which is sponsored by the Polar Programs Office of the U.S. National Science Foundation. ANSMET stands for ANtarctic Search for METeorites, and has been funded since 1977 by the NSF. In that time, ANSMET meteorite hunters have found more than 7000 meteorites, almost triple the number known from outside Antarctica. The Antarctic Meteorite Location and Mapping Project (AMLAMP) provides locations, maps, and databases of meteorite finds.

### Fossil Life in ALH 84001?
>These pages are an explanation of the Science paper of Dr. David McKay and his co-workers, where they give evidence that martian bacteria may have lived in the martian meteorite ALH 84001. I’ve tried to organize and review their evidence that ALH 84001 contains fossils and traces of ancient martian life, and also tried to outline some counter-evidence and some likely questions about the evidence. My intention is to present the work of McKay and co-authors even-handedly and nonjudgmentally.

### [Dear_Jamie](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/)
While i was in atlanta A childhood sweetheart walked backinto my life. She did not tell me she was a sex slave. Alot of what I hear in the [Immigration Reform](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/topics/immigration-reform) headlines and [topics](https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/1200) (S.1200 - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986) would protect her from being sold on the street. But im wondering about how I can stay safe. Theres about 7 women all my age possibly 9 bc they have disquses like [Sartu](https://x.com/sartuadem) is also [Normani The Popstar](https://people.com/normani-calls-boyfriend-dk-metcalf-an-answered-prayer-8658837) so Get this! Erika has a deep history in East Los Angeles. I found a documenary on [Vicky's Town Chronicles](https://www.youtube.com/@VickysTownChronicles) called [Gangster Girls 1999 East LA](https://youtu.be/CIRxStt5jqI?si=SYGl2AUtd1DIZxzx) so she hid that from me, she was stalking me on [OkayPlayer](https://www.okayplayer.com/new-summer-albums-june) and [12ozProphet](https://forum.12ozprophet.com/forum/6-brick-slayers/) and those were not secret but segmented lives when I was a JehovahsWitness! So The confusion i have is that [Prostitution is illegal here!](https://www.keglawyers.com/prostitution-and-solicitation-penal-code-647b#:~:text=California%20Penal%20Code%20647). I never told you but a big part of the black community dont like me working here... I have been tortured and sabotaged eversince month 2 of my employment post [Mori Associates](https://moriassociates.com/) [Mori on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mori-associates) and when [Jose Pi](https://community.pmi.org/profile/josempi#_=_) <a href="https://static.projectmanagement.com/images/profile-photos/46666245_120718014114_p.jpg"><img src="https://static.projectmanagement.com/images/profile-photos/46666245_120718014114_p.jpg" style="width:180px;height:252px;margin-right:5px;padding:10px;" align="left" alt="Pineapple" /> </a> told me i could not come back, i was coming in later than 8am bc i was troubleshooting [AirQuality](https://eospso.nasa.gov/earth-observer-archive) which is normal when your wife is having seizurs and your 3 year old is waking up in pools of blood!~ like it was serious! So now i understand that for the Pornography mob to take a family they havce to disable the breadwinner. Erika suggested we live outside, but that was a set up to dump me and i held on to the child as long as possible taking remote, devops and any position that would get me to the next meal with the kid and whatever i needed to keep her mother from running out in front of a car (YuppieSex). So The brown girl in the photo looks like #Muna_Ahmed from atlanta it could be Normani but we had a serious sexual relationship in georgia and she wanted to grow with a stable partner. And Coral was not a blacck Eye for a relationship bc She was happy and had dreadlocks the brown girls were from Africa so they loved me as a father and wanted to have a baby and We just continue. Then Muna died and Normani stepped in as Sartu at Muna funeral. I ended up back in California after someone saw Normani or Muna leave my East Atlanta Cottage (631 moreland ave) my life fell apart. Dwayne_Gooden of IonicSecurity and [USMC](https://www.marines.mil/) Started bullying me and saying Ethiopian girls are hard to get. He brought me in his office to talk about nightlife an i was questioned on "fuckinBitchiz" its a foriegn concept bc those prostitutes aka groupies are like stage children in regular population and being a JehovahsWitness stage child im a quick go to after they done murdered some pimp or something! And I want a peacful life. The guys that buy them for sex often molest children or turn a blind eye to it, so what do I do? i never bought anyone for sex or raped or even took advantage of anyone, maybe erika a little bit bc deepdown i knew we were just friends... But about the amout of women, they always comhome after they get a free break [MagicCity](https://www.magiccity.com/) dont talk about what they do to local men to perform... its dark, i want to work and earn money please help me
